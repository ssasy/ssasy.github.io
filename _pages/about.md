I am a PhD student of the [Cryptography, Security and Privacy (CrySP) Lab](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo, where I am supervised by [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/). My main research interests are security and privacy, focusing on designing solutions for enabling privacy-preserving communications and data analytics online.
