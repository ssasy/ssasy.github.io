I am a PhD candidate in the [Cryptography, Security, and Privacy (CrySP) group](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/)  at the University of Waterloo, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/).
Before that, I completed my Master's under the supervision of [Sergey Gorbunov](https://sergeyg.tech/).
I have also spend two wonderful terms over the course of my PhD as a research intern with Microsoft Research Cambridge under the supervision of [Andrew Paverd](https://ajpaverd.org/) (Spring 2022) and [Olya Ohrimenko](https://oohrimenko.github.io/) (Winter 2019).


I am interested in computer security and privacy problems broadly.
My research aims to improve individuals' digital privacy by designing efficient solutions for privacy-preserving computations and communications.
In particular, my research topics include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li> Privacy-preserving computations </li>
    <ul>
    <li> Oblivious RAM (ORAMs) </li>
    <li> Oblivious data structures and algorithms</li>
    <li> Privacy-preserving machine learning</li>
    <li> Privacy-preserving databases </li>
    </ul>

<li> Privacy-preserving communications </li>
    <ul>
    <li> Anonymous communications systems </li>
    <li> Metadata-protected communications systems </li>
    </ul>

<li> Differential privacy </li>

<li> Zero-knowledge proof systems</li>

</ul>

I'm always happy to collaborate on or discuss exciting research in any of these areas. The easiest way to get in touch with me is via email.

My Erdős number is 3 (Paul Erdős -> Doug Stinson -> Ian Goldberg -> Sajin Sasy).
