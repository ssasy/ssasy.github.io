I am a Tenure-Track Faculty at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en).
My research aims to improve individuals' digital privacy by designing efficient solutions for privacy-preserving computations and communications.

I received my Ph.D. from [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), where I was a part of the [Cryptography, Security, and Privacy (CrySP) group](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) and fortunate to be supervised by [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/). Prior to that, I completed my Master's under the supervision of [Sergey Gorbunov](https://sergeyg.tech/). I also spent two wonderful terms over the course of my PhD as a research intern with Microsoft Research Cambridge under the supervision of [Andrew Paverd](https://ajpaverd.org/) (Spring 2022) and [Olya Ohrimenko](https://oohrimenko.github.io/) (Winter 2019).

<b> I am Hiring! </b> I am currently seeking motivated students interested in pursuing a PhD. I also have a Postdoc opening within my group.
If you are excited about working on cutting-edge privacy enhancing technologies (below is a broad list of areas my research spans), please drop me an email with your CV and interests. 

My current research areas include:

<ul>
<li> Privacy-preserving computations </li>
    <ul>
    <li> Oblivious RAM (ORAMs) </li>
    <li> Oblivious data structures and algorithms</li>
    <li> Privacy-preserving machine learning</li>
    <li> Privacy-preserving databases </li>
    </ul>

<li> Privacy-preserving communications </li>
    <ul>

    <li> Metadata-protected communications systems </li>
    </ul>

<li> Differential privacy </li>

<li> Zero-knowledge proof systems</li>

</ul>

I'm always happy to collaborate on or discuss exciting research in any of these areas. 
The easiest way to get in touch with me is via email.

My Erdős number is 3 (Paul Erdős -> Doug Stinson -> Ian Goldberg -> Sajin Sasy).
